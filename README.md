We apply 4 different algorithms to classify a dataset contains nodule and non-nodule CT scans of lung. 

The dataset is taken from the LUNA16 and goes through some processing steps which I don't public here. You can find the original dataset here "https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/"

The 4 methods we introduce are SVM, Random Forest, CNN and Stacked Auto Encoder.
